MACHINE LEARNING BOOTCAMP

((The code which has similar name to these correspond to the respective code))
I have implemented the algorithms of:
1.	Linear regression      
2.	Polynomial regression
3.	Logistic regression
4.	KNN
5.	K means clustering 
6.	Neural network for regression and classification


Linear_regression: Regression basically means there is a continues data and we need to predict the value for the given input. The code is such that it is applicable on any type of data set.
                Initially when the code runs it asks to input the file name, there we are supposed to input the train data set and later on once the parameters are been found then it asks us to upload the test data set.


Polynomial_regression:           Same like linear regression i will write the code of polynomial regression. Here I will defined the function that creates the higher degrees of the features and after that the code is similar to that of the linear regression.  

    Initially when the code runs it asks to input the file name, there we are supposed to input the train data set and later on once the parameters are been found then it asks us to upload the test data set.


Logistic_regression: This is the first code of the classification problem. In this code I have used complete vectorised implementation to perform the one vs all type of classification. The code performs one vs all implementation

KNN:This code also solves the classification problem. Here had to see many videos from YouTube and to go through documents to get the feel of the code and the logic behind it. This code doesnâ€™t have the training time, Its direct testing time. 


kmeans_clustering:  This was the first unsupervised code that I performed. The main aim of this code was to form the clusters.
Learnt a new tern called wcss which stands for within the cluster sum of squares, which acts as the cost of this algorithm.


NN: In this code I have implemented 2 layer neural network algorithm. For the classification part did the forward propagation and did to get the gradient use the backward propagation. The units inside the hidden layer I took it as 2/3 of the input layer.

Did complete vectorised implementation.
